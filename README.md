Child Assessment and Reporting Online

Preschool teachers are required to produce reports about the children they look after. There is a lot of paperwork around checklists, the format, what needs to be checked and when, as well as scheduling followup observations. At the end of each term a report needs to be sent to the parents. There is also a standard two-year check.

There is an app to do this already, but the preschools cannot afford the licence. This is a free implementation.
